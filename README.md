# Image-Classifier-Computer-Vision
 This Project combines the magic of Machine Learning and Computer Vision to classify images into one of four superheroes. Powered by a Python backend (Flask + OpenCV + a trained ML model) and presented through a Flutter mobile app, this project is a full-stack demonstration of real-time AI-powered image classification.
